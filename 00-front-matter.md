## About the Author

**Horace Chan** is a lifelong engineer who thinks in code but dreams in symbols. After years spent working with computers, networks, and algorithms, he became fascinated by how the same numerical languages that power software—binary, hex, timestamps, hashes—could be used as a mirror for the human psyche.

*Base 16 Numerology* grew out of that obsession: a project to fuse Unix time, ASCII, and open‑source–style thinking with the ancient urge to find meaning in numbers. Horace writes for readers who are just mystical enough to enjoy a good archetype, and just skeptical enough to want to see the math underneath it.
