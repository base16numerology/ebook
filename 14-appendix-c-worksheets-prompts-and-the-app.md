## Appendix C – Worksheets, Prompts, and the App

Because Base 16 Numerology relies on Unix timestamps and hash functions, all heavy arithmetic is delegated to the companion website and mobile app.

A typical workflow:

1. Enter birth date, time, and place → app computes Unix time, runs LIBRE‑256, and returns your **Hex Life Path** digit and archetype.  
2. Enter your full birth name → app hashes it to give **Expression**, and separately hashes vowels and consonants for **Soul Urge** and **Personality**.  
3. Ask the app to generate **Personal Hex Years** over a range of calendar years.  
4. Optionally hash addresses, project names, and other strings to see their digits.

You can print or copy worksheets with spaces for:

- Life Path, Expression, Soul Urge, Personality, Maturity digits and archetypes.  
- Personal Hex Year logs with space for themes and events.  
- Relationship overlay sheets comparing two charts.  
- Daily or weekly reflection prompts keyed to your current hex cycle.

The app does the code. The worksheets and your journal do the meaning‑making.

Ultimately, the numbers are just an interface. The real program is your life.
